Assignment 1: **Prime Service**
-The AllPrimeQueries project is designed to handle queries generated by multiple clients, each of which might be accessing or updating shared data simultaneously. To manage this concurrency safely and efficiently, the project uses a synchronized HashMap to store queries, ensuring thread-safe access and updates.
-Additionally, by implementing the Runnable interface, this project is designed with scalability in mind, allowing future extensions to run instances of AllPrimeQueries in separate threads.
